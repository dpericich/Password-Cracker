# Password Cracker - Optimized Brute Force Login Tool

### What this App is

I had been doing research on how hackers are able to get value from encrypted password artifacts and found out about bulk translations of dictionaries using trap door functions. Though this app does not use the same methods as that because not every would be hacker has access to comprimised database tables.

### How to use this App

This app is only meant for learning more about cybersecurity, specifically good password and login practice. This is not meant as a tool for actual hacking as there are many more modifications that would need to be made for this to be practical for use. If you'd like to run this locally, run `git pull git@github.com:dpericich/Password-Cracker.git` to pull down the repo. Run `bundle install` to install all the necessary gems and then start the app with `rails`.
